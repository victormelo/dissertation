\chapter{Introduction}
% ----------------------------------------------------------

In the modern society, biometric technology is used in several security applications for personal authentication. The aim of such systems is to confirm the identity of a given subject based on physiological or behavioral traits. In the first case, recognition is based on biological characteristics such as fingerprint, palm print, iris, face. The latter relies on behavioral traits such as voice pattern and handwritten signature \cite{jain2004biometrics}.

The Handwritten Signature biometry stands as one of the primary methods for identity authentication. One of the reasons for its widespread is the fact that signature acquisition is easy, non-invasive, and most individuals are familiar with its use in their daily life \cite{impedovo2008state}. Due to its convenient nature, signatures can be employed as a sign of confirmation in a wide variety of documents, namely, bank checks, identification documents and a variety of business certificates and contracts.

As a behavioral trait, signatures present a high intra-user variability and are susceptible to spoof attacks, which is the attempt to forge the signature of a legitimate subject \cite{jain2004biometrics}. Two types of impostors are considered: casual impostors (producing random forgeries) when no information about authentic writer signature is known, and real impostors (producing skilled forgeries) when some information of the signature is used \cite{fierrez2008handbook}.

If a signature on a document is forged, this document is also considered invalid. Thus, preventing frauds in the signature verification process has been a challenge for researchers around the world. However, manual signature-based authentication of a large set of documents is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Hence, several Automatic Handwritten Signature Verification Systems (AHSVS) have been proposed to support this task. These systems aim to automatically decide if a query signature is in fact of a particular person or not.

An AHSVS is essentially a pattern recognition system that receives a signature as input, extracts a feature set from the data and classifies the sample using a template database as the reference. These datasets contain signatures digitized either by using an optical scanner to obtain the signature directly from the paper or using an acquisition device such as digitizing tablets or electronic pens with digital ink. The two domains are identified as offline (static) and online (dynamic), respectively.  In the online modality, data is stored during the writing process and consists of a temporal sequence of the two-dimensional coordinates (x, y) of consecutive points, whereas in the offline case, only a static representation of the completed writing is available as an image. Moreover, each representation has specific attributes not present in the other \cite{viard1999ireste}. 

The amount of samples used for training the signature verification system can place some effect on the system's performance, the bigger the training database, the better the system's performance. Since the acquisition and distribution of real signatures arise legal and privacy concerns, the use of realistic synthetic signatures could be regarded as a good alternative. As a consequence, over the last years, several works on both online \cite{galbally2009synthetic, galbally2012synthetic} and offline \cite{ferrer2013synthetic, ferrer2013realistic} signature synthesis have been carried out. These synthetically generated signatures show a similar behavior to real ones, thus enabling to enlarge existing databases and offering new possibilities for offline recognition.

Some efforts have been performed on the generation of synthetic static data taking into account dynamic features during the synthesis process \cite{diaz2014generation}. Among others, this type of synthesis approach presents some practical applications:
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item generation of synthetic static samples to be fused with the original online signatures in order to improve the performance in an online verification scenario;
  \item enlargement of existing offline signature databases;
  \item development of systems capable of integrating both online and offline samples interchangeably, towards a unified signature biometry \cite{chapter}.
\end{inlinelist}

Despite the advancements for this category of synthesis, the synthetic offline samples created with the state-of-the-art systems still struggle to improve the recognition rates when used to enlarge existing offline signature databases.


In this work, we propose an approach based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) trained in a supervised manner, to learn the representation of offline manuscripts using as the input the online representation, expecting that the network predicts the corresponding static sample. This type of approach is interesting for our problem since the neural network learns how the dynamic features, in particular, the pressure, of the online representation of the manuscript translates into the static domain (pen on the paper). 

In contrast to the models proposed in the literature \cite{ferrer2013synthetic, ferrer2013realistic, diaz2014generation}, the approach presented in this work is designed under the perspective of supervised training. In which a learning model is trained to perform the task of ``online to offline conversion'' using as the training data a data set containing both the online and offline versions of manuscripts. We expect that the Deep Neural Network model can learn how online information is transformed into the offline manuscript. Moreover, we expect that the trained model synthesizes offline signatures with improved discriminative power (i.e., better recognition rates). 

\section{Problem statement}
Encouraged by the motivations depicted previously the goal of this dissertation can be stated as follows:

\textit{"The goal of this work is to design an approach to generate synthetic offline handwriting signatures based on online data, modeling this problem as a supervised machine learning task, through a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, in order to enlarge offline signature datasets to improve offline signature verification systems recognition rates."}

This statement is developed through the following actions:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item Creation and training of a Deep Neural Network model able to translate dynamic handwritten information into an offline manuscript
\item Generation of an offline synthetic dataset based on a publicly available online signature dataset
\item Comparison of the proposed approachâ€™s performance with a state-of-the-art method to evaluate the closeness of synthetic signatures with respect to real signatures. 
\end{inlinelist}

To achieve point (iii), machine-oriented validations are carried out. A state-of-the-art automatic signature verifier is used to evaluate our synthetic samples versus real offline signatures from a publicly available dataset. It is expected that similar results would be obtained with both the real and our proposed method synthetic signatures. Moreover, we also evaluate the use of synthetic signatures in the genuine enrollment set, analyzing the differences in the offline verification system recognition rates.

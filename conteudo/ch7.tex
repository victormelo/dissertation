\chapter{Conclusion and Future Works}


A novel method to synthesize off-line signatures
from dynamic information has been proposed. We describe our Neural Network approach that learns how to transform on-line manuscripts into static samples taking advantage of the data present in the IRONOFF dataset. 

We observe that our proposed synthetic images offer better performance when compared to the state of the art and similar performance to real signatures. We show that the synthetic signatures present high discriminative power when used to increase the enrollment set under the skilled forgeries scenario, one of the biggest challenges in handwriting recognition. 

We intend to explore in future works the combination of real on-line and
synthetically generated off-line signatures from our method, when only the on-line information is available, towards improved recognition results.

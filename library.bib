abstract = {Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a {\{}$\backslash$em plausible{\}} color version of the photograph. This problem is clearly underconstrained, so previous approaches have either relied on significant user interaction or resulted in desaturated colorizations. We propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic colorizations. We embrace the underlying uncertainty of the problem by posing it as a classification task and explore using class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. The system is implemented as a feed-forward operation in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a "colorization Turing test", asking human subjects to choose between a generated and ground truth color image. Our method successfully fools humans 20$\backslash${\%} of the time, significantly higher than previous methods.},

abstract = {In this study, the effects of using handheld devices on the performance of automatic signature verification systems are studied. The authors compare the discriminative power of global and local signature features between mobile devices and pen tablets, which are the prevalent acquisition device in the research literature. Individual feature discriminant ratios and feature selection techniques are used for comparison. Experiments are conducted on standard signature benchmark databases (BioSecure database) and a state-of-the-art device (Samsung Galaxy Note). Results show a decrease in the feature discriminative power and a higher verification error rate on handheld devices. It is found that one of the main causes of performance degradation on handheld devices is the absence of pen-up trajectory information (i.e. data acquired when the pen tip is not in contact with the writing surface).},

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

To overcome this problem, techniques to generate synthetic data have been developed. This paper describes a novel technique for the automatic synthesis of human handwritten-signature images, which introduces modeled variability within the generated output based on positional variation that is naturally found within genuine source data. The synthesized data were found to generate similar verification rates to those obtained using genuine data with the use of a commercial verification engine, thereby indicating the suitability of the data synthesized by using this method for a wide range of application scenarios.},

Using 5 or 10 signatures for training is the most common case to evaluate ASV. In the scarcely addressed case of only one available signature for training, we propose to use modified duplicates. Our novel technique relies on a fully neuromuscular representation of the signatures based on the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model. This way, a real on-line signature is converted into the Sigma-Lognormal model domain. The model parameters are then varied to generate new duplicated signatures.},

@article{Ferrer2015,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a new method for generating synthetic handwritten signature images for biometric applications. The procedures we introduce imitate the mechanism of motor equivalence which divides human handwriting into two steps: the working out of an effector independent action plan and its execution via the corresponding neuromuscular path. The action plan is represented as a trajectory on a spatial grid. This contains both the signature text and its flourish, if there is one. The neuromuscular path is simulated by applying a kinematic Kaiser filter to the trajectory plan. The length of the filter depends on the pen speed which is generated using a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model. An ink deposition model, applied pixel by pixel to the pen trajectory, provides realistic static signature images. The lexical and morphological properties of the synthesized signatures as well as the range of the synthesis parameters have been estimated from real databases of real signatures such as the MCYT Off-line and the GPDS960GraySignature corpuses. The performance experiments show that by tuning only four parameters it is possible to generate synthetic identities with different stability and forgers with different skills. Therefore it is possible to create datasets of synthetic signatures with a performance similar to databases of real signatures. Moreover, we can customize the created dataset to produce skilled forgeries or simple forgeries which are easier to detect, depending on what the researcher needs. Perceptual evaluation gives an average confusion of 44.06 percent between real and synthetic signatures which shows the realism of the synthetic ones. The utility of the synthesized signatures is demonstrated by studying the influence of the pen type and number of users on an automatic signature verifier.},

This paper presents an efficient off-line human signature recognition system based on support vector machines (SVM) and compares its performance with a traditional classification technique, multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). In both cases we propose two approaches to the problem: (1) construct each feature vector using a set of global geometric and moment-based characteristics from each signature and (2) construct the feature vector using the bitmap of the corresponding signature. We also present a mechanism to capture the intrapersonal variability of each user using just one original signature. Our results empirically show that SVM, which achieves up to 71{\%} correct recognition rate, outperforms MLP. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Galbally2015,
abstract = {On-line signature verification still remains a challenging task within biometrics. Due to their behavioural nature (opposed to anatomic biometric traits), signatures present a notable variability even between successive realizations. This leads to higher error rates than other largely used modalities such as iris or fingerprints and is one of the main reasons for the relatively slow deployment of this technology. As a step towards the improvement of signature recognition accuracy, the present paper explores and evaluates a novel approach that takes advantage of the performance boost that can be reached through the fusion of on-line and off-line signatures. In order to exploit the complementarity of the two modalities, we propose a method for the generation of enhanced synthetic static samples from on-line data. Such synthetic off-line signatures are used on a new on-line signature recognition architecture based on the combination of both types of data: real on-line samples and artificial off-line signatures synthesized from the real data. The new on-line recognition approach is evaluated on a public benchmark containing both real versions (on-line and off-line) of the exactly same signatures. Different findings and conclusions are drawn regarding the discriminative power of on-line and off-line signatures and of their potential combination both in the random and skilled impostors scenarios.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

Generating images is easier than recognizing them, for the computer systems that we have today. This work leverages the ability to generate images, for the purpose of recognizing other images. One part of this thesis introduces a thorough implementation of this “analysis by synthesis” idea in a sophisticated autoencoder. Half of the image generation system (namely the structure of the system) is hard-coded; the other half (the content inside that structure) is learned. At the same time as this image generation system is being learned, an accompanying image recognition system is learning to extract descriptions from images. Learning together, these two components develop an excellent understanding of the provided data. The second part of the thesis is an algorithm for training undirected generative models, by making use of a powerful interaction between training and a Markov Chain whose task is to produce samples from the model. This algorithm is shown to work well on image data, but is equally applicable to undirected generative models of other types of data.},

Such recognition systems capture the personal signing behaviour and its variability based on a limited number of enrolled signatures. In this paper a cognitive inspired model based on motor equivalence theory is developed to duplicate off-line signatures from one real on-line seed. This model achieves duplicated signatures with a natural variability. It is validated with an off-line signature verifier based on texture features and a SVM classifier. The results manifest the complementarity of the duplicated signatures and the utility of the model.},

abstract = {This paper studies online signature verification on touch interface-based mobile devices. A simple and effective method for signature verification is developed. An online signature is represented with a discriminative feature vector derived from attributes of several histograms that can be computed in linear time. The resulting signature template is compact and requires constant space. The algorithm was first tested on the well-known MCYT-100 and SUSIG data sets. The results show that the performance of the proposed technique is comparable and often superior to state-of-the-art algorithms despite its simplicity and efficiency. In order to test the proposed method on finger drawn signatures on touch devices, a data set was collected from an uncontrolled environment and over multiple sessions. Experimental results on this data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in mobile settings. The results demonstrate the problem of within-user variation of signatures across multiple sessions and the effectiveness of cross session training strategies to alleviate these problems.},

We present a system that uses a score-level fusion of complementary classifiers that use different local features (histogram of oriented gradients, local binary patterns and scale invariant feature transform descriptors), where each classifier uses a feature-level fusion to represent local features at coarse-to-fine levels. For classifiers, two different approaches are investigated, namely global and user-dependent classifiers. User-dependent classifiers are trained separately for each user, to learn to differentiate that user's genuine signatures from other signatures; while a single global classifier is trained with difference vectors of query and reference signatures of all users in the training set, to learn the importance of different types of dissimilarities.The fusion of all classifiers achieves a state-of-the-art performance with 6.97{\%} equal error rate in skilled forgery tests using the public GPDS-160 signature database. The proposed system does not require skilled forgeries of the enrolling user, which is essential for real life applications.},

Two modalities (signatures and handwritten text) are considered and training and evaluation data are collected and provided by FHEs and PR-researchers. Four tasks are defined for four different languages; Bengali offline signature verification, Italian off-line signature verification, German on-line signature verification, and English handwritten text based writer identification. In total, 40 systems have participated in this competition. The participants of the signatures modality were motivated to report their results in Likelihood Ratios (LRs). This has made the systems even more interesting for application in forensic casework. For evaluating the performance of the systems, we have used the forensically substantial Cost of Log Likelihood Ratios ( bCllr) in the case of signatures, and the F-measure in the case of handwritten text.},

An overall match rating is generated by combining the outputs at each scale.

We expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, 128x128 samples are more than twice as discriminable as artificially resized 32x32 samples. In addition, 84.7{\%} of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real ImageNet data.},

This chapter is concerned with automatic methods for verifying the writership of handwritten documents and signatures. The discussion consists of the individuality of handwriting, image pre-processing and interactive tools for forensic document examination, discriminating characteristics of handwriting, a statistical model of writer verification, and application of the model to signature verification. 1},

AIS are particularly successful in fault detection and diagnosis applications where anomalies such as errors and failures are assimilated to viruses that should be detected. Thereby, AIS seem suitable to automatically detect forgeries in signature verification systems. This paper proposes a novel method for off-line signature verification that is based on the Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS). For feature generation, two different descriptors are proposed to generate signature traits. The first is the Gradient Local Binary Patterns that estimates gradient features based on the LBP neighborhood. The second descriptor is the Longest Run Feature, which describes the signature topology by considering longest suites of text pixels. Performance evaluation is carried out on CEDAR and GPDS-100 datasets. The results obtained showed that the proposed system has promising performance and often comfortably outperforms the state of the art.},

abstract = {Abstract Handwritten signature is one of the oldest means of the human being to both authenticate him/herself and state that a certain document has been understood and accepted. In the modern world, this biometric modality was translated to the use of peripheral pads that allow the signature to be performed by the user. However, in the recent years, the proliferation of mobile devices with touch screens has paved the path to deploy this biometric modality beyond the limits of a desktop. Bringing this biometric modality to mobile devices open several challenges, being some of them already covered, but some others needing further study. This paper provides an overview of these challenges and point to future research works that can help to the continuous deployment of this biometric modality. },

Two off-line and two on-line recognition approaches exploiting information at the global and local levels are used. Experimental results are given using the BiosecurID database (130 signers, 3,640 signatures). Fusion experiments are done using a trained fusion approach based on linear logistic regression. It is shown experimentally that the local systems outperform the global ones, both in the on-line and in the off-line case. We also observe a considerable improvement when combining the two on-line systems, which is not the case with the off-line systems. The best performance is obtained when fusing all the systems together, which is specially evident for skilled forgeries when enough training data is available. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {This Thesis is focused on the quality assessment of biometric signals and its ap- plication to multimodal biometric systems. Since the establishment of biometrics as an specific research area in late 90s, the biometric community has focused its efforts in the development of accurate recognition algorithms and nowadays, biometric recognition is a mature technology that is used in many applications. However, we can notice recent studies that demonstrate how performance of biometric systems is heavily affected by the quality of biometric signals. Quality measurement has emerged in the biometric community as an important concern after the poor performance observed in biometric systems on certain pathological samples. We first summarize the state-of-the-art in the biometric quality problem. We present the factors influencing biometric quality, which mainly have to do with four issues: the individual itself, the sensor used in the acquisition, the user-sensor interac- tion, and the system used for processing and recognition. After that, we give strategies to ensure the best possible quality of acquired biometric samples. Next, we present existing frameworks for evaluation of the performance of biometric quality measures. The relationship between human and automatic quality assessment, as well as the role of quality measures within biometric systems is then analyzed. Lastly, we summarize standardization efforts related to biometric quality and we point out further issues and challenges of the quality problem. The experimental part of the Thesis starts with the study of quality in fingerprint images. We evaluate the impact of selected image quality measures in the performance of the two most used approaches for fingerprint recognition using a multi-session and a multi-sensor database. It is observed high correlation between the different quality measures in most cases, although some differences are found depending on the sensor. The behavior of the two matchers under varying image quality conditions has been also found to be different. We then study the problem of quality assessment in off-line signature images. We present several measures aimed to predict the performance of off-line signature verifica- tion systems measuring factors like signature legibility, complexity, stability, duration, etc. We also present a new matcher based on local contour features, which is com- pared with two other approaches. Some remarkable findings of this chapter are that better performance is obtained with legible signatures and skilled forgeries, or that performance is worsened with highly variable signatures. Finally, we contribute with a quality-based multibiometric architecture that is gen- eralizable to biometric systems working with multiple sources of information (different modalities, matchers, acquisition devices, etc.). In this approach, quality is used to switch between different system modules depending on the data source, and to con- sider only data of enough quality. We compare the proposed architecture with a set of simple fusion rules. It is demonstrated that the proposed system outperforms the rest when coping with signals originated from heterogeneous biometric sources, pointing out its effectiveness. An additional overall improvement of 25{\%} is observed in the EER by incorporating a quality-based score rejection scheme, showing the benefits of incorporating quality information in biometric systems},

abstract = {Handwritten Signatures are one of the widely used biometrics for document authentication as well as human authorization. The purpose of this paper is to present an offline signature verification system involving Hindi signatures. Signature verification is a process by which the questioned signature is examined in detail in order to determine whether it belongs to the claimed person or not. Despite of substantial research in the field of signature verification involving Western signatures, very little attention has been dedicated to non-Western signatures such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Persian etc. In this paper, the performance of an off-line signature verification system involving Hindi signatures, whose style is distinct from Western scripts, has been investigated. The gradient and Zernike moment features were employed and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were considered for verification. To the best of the authors' knowledge, Hindi signatures have never been used for the task of signature verification and this is the first report of using Hindi signatures in this area. The Hindi signature database employed for experimentation consisted of 840 (35×24) genuine signatures and 1050 (35×30) forgeries. An encouraging accuracy of 7.42{\%} FRR and 4.28{\%} FAR were obtained following experimentation when the gradient features were employed. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The database comprises 400 subjects and presents features such as: realistic acquisition scenario, balanced gender and population distributions, availability of information about particular demographic groups (age, gender, handedness), acquisition of replay attacks for speech and keystroking, skilled forgeries for signatures, and compatibility with other existing databases.

This system is basically divided into three parts: i) off-line verification stage, ii) on-line verification stage and iii) combination module using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). The proposed framework allows combining the normalized SVM outputs and uses an estimation technique based on the dissonant model of Appriou to compute the belief assignments. Combination is performed using Dempster-Shafer (DS) rule followed by the likelihood ratio based decision making. Experiments are conducted on the well know NISDCC signature collection using false rejection and false acceptance criteria. The obtained results show that the proposed combination framework using DST yields the best verification accuracy compared to the sum rule even when individual off-line and on-line classifications provide conflicting results.},

Individual feature discriminant ratios and feature selection techniques are used for comparison. Experiments are conducted on standard signature benchmark databases (BioSecure database) and a state-of-the-art device (Samsung Galaxy Note). Results show a decrease in the feature discriminative power and a higher verification error rate on handheld devices. It is found that one of the main causes of performance degradation on handheld devices is the absence of pen-up trajectory information (i.e. data acquired when the pen tip is not in contact with the writing surface).},

abstract = {Automatic Offline Handwritten Signature Verification has been researched over the last few decades from several perspectives, using insights from graphology, computer vision, signal processing, among others. In spite of the advancements on the field, building classifiers that can separate between genuine signatures and skilled forgeries (forgeries made targeting a particular signature) is still hard. We propose approaching the problem from a feature learning perspective. Our hypothesis is that, in the absence of a good model of the data generation process, it is better to learn the features from data, instead of using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian PUC-PR. Our experimental results show that the features learned in a subset of the users are discriminative for the other users, including across different datasets, reaching close to the state-of-the-art in the GPDS dataset, and improving the state-of-the-art in the Brazilian PUC-PR dataset.},

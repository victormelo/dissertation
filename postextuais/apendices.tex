\textbf{Abstract:} As a result of a wide research in automatic handwritten signature verification, multiple data sets and competitions emerged to cover different tasks for online/offline signature verification and signature segmentation from scanned documents. The purpose of this work is to analyze and discuss the most used data sets in the literature in order to find what are the challenges pursued by the community in the past few years. The data sets, which were collected from recent publications and competitions, are described regarding its main characteristics such as the number of authors, signatures per author and the method used for the acquisition phase. We analyzed several databases used for different topics related to either online or offline signature verification. Since we did not find in this review a data set that can be used to explore signature verification considering different acquisition sources and writing conditions, specifically a data set consisting of dynamic signatures taken from multiple devices and static signatures with diverse signing area constraints and background textures, we introduce a new data set acquired from pen tablets, smartphones and scanned from different types of documents. Therefore, researchers can use this new data set not only to investigate the multi-domain signature verification problem but to take into account in their solutions the signature segmentation problem in real world documents with complex backgrounds.

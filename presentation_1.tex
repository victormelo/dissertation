\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Types of Forgeries}
In the field of signature verification, forgeries are usually classified into two types \parencite {impedovo2008state}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The first one is the random forgery which is created in a situation which an impostor who has no information about the person or the shape of the original signature tries to verify the identity of a signer using his signature instead of the signature to be tested. The forger does not attempt to simulate or trace a genuine signature.

\item The second type is the skilled forgery, in which the forger tries and practices imitating as closely as possible the static and dynamic information of the genuine signature model. The forger has access for both the user’s name and signature and tries to reproduce it with a similar intra-class variability.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data in Signature Verification}

The performance of signature verification systems can be improved by increasing the number of samples in the training dataset. The amount of data available for each user is often insufficient in real applications. During the enrollment phase,
users are often required to supply only a few samples of their signatures. In other words, even if there is a significant number of users enrolled in the system, a classifier needs to perform well for a new user, for whom only a small set of samples are available. Since the acquisition and distribution of real signatures arise legal and privacy concerns \parencite{diaz2014generation}, the use of realistic synthetic signatures could be
regarded as a good alternative. 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Synthetic Samples}

The use of realistic synthetic signatures could be regarded as a good alternative. As a consequence, over the last years, several works on both online \parencite{galbally2009synthetic, galbally2012synthetic} and offline \parencite{ferrer2013synthetic, ferrer2013realistic} signature synthesis have been carried out. These synthetically generated signatures show a similar behavior to real ones, thus enabling to enlarge existing databases and offering new possibilities for offline recognition.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Online to Offline}
Some efforts have been performed on the generation of synthetic static data taking into account dynamic features during the synthesis process \parencite{diaz2014generation}. Among others, this type of synthesis approach presents some practical applications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item generation of synthetic static samples to be fused with the original online signatures in order to improve the performance in an online verification scenario;
  \item enlargement of existing offline signature databases;
  \item development of systems capable of integrating both online and offline samples interchangeably, towards a unified signature biometry \parencite{chapter}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goal}


In contrast to the models proposed in the literature \parencite{ferrer2013synthetic, ferrer2013realistic, diaz2014generation}, the approach presented in this work is designed under the perspective of supervised training. 

\textit{"The goal of this work is to design an approach to generate synthetic offline handwriting signatures based on online data, modeling this problem as a supervised machine learning task, through a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, in order to enlarge offline signature datasets to improve offline signature verification systems recognition rates."}

This statement is developed through the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creation and training of a Deep Neural Network model able to translate dynamic handwritten information into an offline manuscript
\item Generation of an offline synthetic dataset based on a publicly available online signature dataset
\item Comparison of the proposed approach’s performance with a state-of-the-art method to evaluate the closeness of synthetic signatures with respect to real signatures. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-line Signature Synthesis Using On-line Samples}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Off-line Signature Synthesis Using On-line Samples}
According to \parencite{guest2013assessment}, although online samples can be stored as a time-series for use in any form of an AHSVS, there are situations where it might be needed to represent the data as an image reproducing the original static signature. 
\end{frame}

\section{Neural Networks and Deep Learning}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Neural Networks}
The human brain is a complex, non-linear and parallel ``computer'' consisting of \textbf{millions of connected neurons} \parencite{haykin2009neural}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Perceptron}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{perceptron}
\caption{Perceptron representation. $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ represent the input signal, $b$ the bias term, $w_{0}$, $w_{1}$, $w_{2}$ the weights, $f_{\:\sum}$ is the activation function (in this case, a step function) and the output signal is given by $y$.}
\label{perceptron}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multilayer Perceptron}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.7\textheight]{mlp}
\caption{Each layer contains several perceptron units, which are then connected to units in the subsequent layer.}
\label{mlp}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multilayer Perceptron}
An MLP can be thought of as a function that maps from input to output vectors, parameterized by the neuron connection weights. The output of a layer
is calculated by applying the neuron activation function for all neurons on the layer, as
noted below
\begin{equation}
y^{(l)} = f(W^{(l)} y^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)})
\label{eq:outputmlp}
\end{equation}
where $W^{(l)}$ is a matrix of weights assigned to each pair of neurons from layer $l$ and $l-1$, and $b^{(l)}$ is a vector of bias terms for each neuron in layer $l$. Calculating the output starting from the first hidden layer, up to the output layer is also referred to as the \textit{forward propagation} phase.
\end{frame}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Figure extracted from \parencite{galbally2015line}}
\label{fig:dualonoff}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Training Data}
Dual modal signature datasets (BiosecurID, Biomet, MyIdea, Sigcomp2009, Sigma, SigwiComp2013, SigWiComp2015)  had not this characteristic satisfied. Both of the representations of the signatures do not match if we plot it in a single image.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{A sample from the BiosecurID dataset. Here we can see that the online signature (interpolated in red) can not be projected in the respective offline version.}
\label{fig:onoff}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Training Data}
The dual domain IRONOFF \parencite{viard1999ireste} handwriting dataset was thus used to train our model. Besides acquiring both domains of the handwriting manuscript, the online data is mapped to the same coordinate system of the offline data.

Using this dataset, we make the fair assumption that a handwritten signature is a manuscript. With that in mind, we expect that even if the network was trained on handwriting manuscripts, it would work for online signatures to generate its static version.

The IRONOFF dataset contains a total of 23000 mapped online and offline samples of the manuscripts. The offline handwriting signals have been sampled with a spatial resolution of 300 dots per inch (DPI), with 8 bits per pixel (256 gray level).

\section{Evaluation Setup}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Evaluation Setup}
In order to evaluate the quality of the synthetic signatures generated by our system we follow the same protocol presented on the work of Diaz \textit{et al.} \cite{diaz2014generation}. Namely, we use a state-of-the-art offline verification system and a dataset comprising both online and offline signatures in order to train the verification system to evaluate the synthetic signatures.

The goal of the experiments is to measure the quality of the synthetic signatures taking into account an offline verification system performance. The questions raised are 

\begin{itemize}
  \item is the synthetic signatures system performance similar to the offered by real offline signatures?
  \item is it feasible to increase the number of samples at the enrollment stage with our proposed method synthetic signatures? 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Offline signature verification system}
\section{Off-line signature verification system}
The system used for the evaluation of the real and synthetic signatures is a Linear SVM classifier and with a state-of-the-art feature extraction approach  \cite{hafemann2017learning}. The feature extraction system \footnote{https://www.etsmtl.ca/Unites-de-recherche/LIVIA/Recherche-et-innovation/Projets/Signature-Verification} uses ideas from transfer learning and multi-task learning to learn features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As discussed in Chapter before, one of the advantages of using deep learning techniques is that some models, such as the CNN, can learn filters that can be used as feature extractors. The offline system's feature extractor takes advantage of this concept.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Database}
The evaluation experiments were carried out on the BiosecurID database \cite{biosecurid}. This multimodal database was made publicly available containing signatures of 132 subjects. Signatures were captured using a special digital inking pen on a paper placed over a digitizing tablet, exactly as shown in Figure \ref{fig:onoff}. Consequently, both versions, online and offline, of the same real signature were acquired at the same time. This characteristic, therefore, makes BiosecurID the ideal benchmark for the experimental evaluation conducted in this work.


The signatures samples were captured in 4 different sessions, distributed over four months. Each subject signed 4 times and forged 3 signatures per session, thus leading to each subject having 4 genuine signatures x 4 sessions = 16 genuine samples and 3 signature forgeries x 4 sessions = 12 skilled forgeries.

Since the offline signature verification system is trained with both positive and negative samples, to ensure an unbiased result towards the dataset selection, similar to the protocol followed by \cite{diaz2014generation} we used the MCYT database \cite{mcyt-100} as the negative dataset samples. The MCYT dataset includes 75 signers each with 15 genuine and 15 skilled forged signatures. The amount of negative samples was set to 25 random samples from the MCYT dataset.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experiments Protocol}
We follow the same experiment protocol proposed by \cite{diaz2014generation}. 
Two different experiments are carried out. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Experiment 1 focus on evaluating the synthetic signatures performance in comparison to real signatures
\item Experiment 2 evaluates the feasibility of synthetically increasing the number of samples available in a dataset.
\end{itemize}

For both experiments, the BiosecurID dataset is split into two subsets. The first 90 users are separated as the enrollment set, used to compute the genuine and skilled impostor scores. The remaining 42 authors are considered as the test set and are used to compute the random impostor scores. The performance is evaluated regarding the equal error rate (EER), which is the point in the Detection Error Tradeoff curve (DET) where the false acceptance rate equals the false rejection rate.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experiments Protocol}
We follow the same experiment protocol proposed by \cite{diaz2014generation}. 
Two different experiments are carried out. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Experiment 1 focus on evaluating the synthetic signatures performance in comparison to real signatures
\item Experiment 2 evaluates the feasibility of synthetically increasing the number of samples available in a dataset.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\caption{The proposed approach diagram and an example of the synthetic signature generation.}
\label{fig:multiandmono}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experiment 2}
This experiment is designed to assess whether synthetically increasing the enrollment dataset leads to a better recognition performance. Three different enrollment sets are considered in this experiment: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 real samples belonging to the
  first acquisition session
  \item 8 real samples belonging to the first and
  the second sessions
  \item 4 real samples belonging
  to the first session plus 4 synthetic samples belonging
  to the second session.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Results}
\begin{frame}{Results}
The goal of the experiments are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Measure the quality of the synthetic images;
  \item Assess whether using synthetic signatures effects the recognition performance of an offline signature verification system; and
  \item Analyze the feasibility of using real and synthetic signatures
  on the enrollment set.
\end{itemize}

We compare our results with a state-of-the-art method, particularly the approach proposed by Diaz \textit{et al.} \cite{diaz2014generation}. Specifically, our proposed method is compared with the ``Image enhanced'' synthetic signatures made available as part of the BiosecurID \cite{biosecurid} dataset. The reported EER is achieved for both approaches in the same experimental conditions.

The recognition rates of three types of offline signatures are reported: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item real offline signatures, which are the corresponding real offline samples of the online signatures used to generate the synthetic samples, they serve us as a ground-truth, i.e., the ideal synthetic signature should be similar to it;
  \item synthetic signatures generated with the method proposed by Diaz \textit{et al.} \cite{diaz2014generation};
  \item synthetic signatures created with our proposed method
\end{itemize}.

\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item A Fully Convolutional Neural Network to learn an end-to-end mapping from the online to the offline domain was proposed;
\item We show that it is possible to model the "online to offline signature conversion" as a learning from data task.
\item We observe that the synthetic offline signatures generated with the proposed method offer a verification performance similar to the one offered by real signatures 
\item We show that the synthetic signatures present high discriminative power when used to increase the enrollment set under the skilled forgeries scenario.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Future Works}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explore the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the FCN
(such as the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, different architectures)
\item Integrate other dynamic features in addition to the pressure on the input of the neural network, such as the velocity.
\item Design a model to synthesize offline signatures with bigger resolution.

\item Combine real online and synthetically generated offline signatures using the
proposed method, when only the online information is available, towards improved
recognition results on a dynamic signature verifier.

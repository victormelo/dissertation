\begin{block}{Biometry Categories}
\begin{itemize}
\item Physiological - biological characteristics such as fingerprint, palm print, iris, face.
\item Behavioral - individual acquired traits such as voice pattern and handwritten signature. 

\end{itemize}

\end{block}

 \note{Biometric techonology is used in several security applications for person authentication.
  \vskip 0.2cm
  The word BIOMETRICS is derived from the GREEK - where bio means life and metriks means to measure.
 \vskip 0.2cm
 A Biometric Identifier is ``A UNIQUE MEASURABLE CHARACTERISTIC USED TO DISTINGUISH AND DESCRIBE INDIVIDUALS''
 \vskip 0.2cm The aim of those systems is to confirm the identity of a given subject based on \textbf{PHYSIOLOGICAL or BEHAVIORAL} traits. \textbf{NEXT SLIDE} 
 }
 \note{\vskip 0.5cm *** In \textbf{PHYSIOLOGICAL} biometric systems, the reconigiton is based on MEASUREMENTS OF THE BODY such as fingerprint, IRIS, face, DNA, and so on. On the other hand \textbf{BEHAVIORAL} biometrics are traits acquired by an individual, those are related to the voice pattern, typing rhythm and handwritten signatures.

\frametitle{Handwritten Signature (2)}

\textbf{The Handwritten Signature widespread can be attributed to \footfullcite{impedovo2008state}:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Signature acquisition is easy and non-invasive;
\item Most individuals are familiar with its use in their daily life;
\item Signatures can be employed as a sign of confirmation in a wide variety of documents, namely, bank checks, identification documents and a variety of business certificates and contracts.
\end{itemize}

 \note{Some of the reasons for handwritten signatures being one of the most widespread biometry, is that \textbf{The Signature acquisition is easy and non-invasive}
 \vskip 0.5cm 
 While most of the biometric identifiers require a special type of device for the identification, handwritten signature based authentication can be performed requiring no sensor except a pen and a piece of paper.
  \vskip 0.5cm 
 Due to its convenient nature, most of individuals are familiar with its use in their daily life
 and Signatures can be employed as a sign of confirmation in a wide set of documents
  \vskip 0.5cm 
 For instance, Bank checks, identification documents and a variety of business certificates and contracts.

\note{
Another challenge faced on signature verification systems is the inter-personal variability... \textbf{The similarity between different writers}.

      \vskip 0.3cm 
    Random forgeries: The forger does not attempt to simulate or trace a genuine signature, he tries to verify the identity of a person using his own signature..

      \vskip 0.3cm On the other hand, a skilled forgery, is made by a forger that tries and practices to imitate as closely as possible the genuine signature model.

%\begin{frame}
%\frametitle{Types of Forgeries}
%In the field of signature verification, forgeries are usually classified into two types \parencite {impedovo2008state}. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The first one is the random forgery which is created in a situation which an impostor who has no information about the person or the shape of the original signature tries to verify the identity of a signer using his signature instead of the signature to be tested. The forger does not attempt to simulate or trace a genuine signature.
%
%\item The second type is the skilled forgery, in which the forger tries and practices imitating as closely as possible the static and dynamic information of the genuine signature model. The forger has access for both the user’s name and signature and tries to reproduce it with a similar intra-class variability.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Signature Verification Performance}
%Performance on signature verification systems is measured by:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Genuine rejected as impostor - False Rejection Rate (FRR)
%\item Forger accepted as genuine - False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\note{
%On the one hand, a genuine signer may be rejected by the system as a potential impostor. False Rejection Rate

\frametitle{Data in Signature Verification}

\vskip 0.2cm

The amount of samples used for training the signature verification system effects the system's performance. 

\vskip 0.2cm

\textbf{As any Pattern Recognition problem, the bigger the dataset, the better the system's performance.}
\vskip 0.2cm

However, in the signature verification context:
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of data available for each user is often insufficient in real applications;
\item  During the enrollment phase, users are often required to supply only a few samples of their signatures;
\item Acquisition and distribution of real signatures arise legal and privacy concerns;

\end{itemize}

\vskip 0.5cm

\centering\textbf{The use of realistic synthetic signatures could be regarded as a good alternative.}

Among others, this type of synthesis approach presents some practical applications:

  \item generation of synthetic static samples to be fused with the original online signatures in order to improve the performance in an online verification scenario;
  \item enlargement of existing offline signature datasets when complementary online data is available;
  \item development of systems capable of integrating both online and offline samples interchangeably, towards a unified signature biometry \parencite{chapter}.

%Using this dataset, we make the fair assumption that a handwritten signature is a manuscript. With that in mind, we expect that even if the network was trained on handwriting manuscripts, it would work for online signatures to generate its static version.

For this reason, we used the IRONOFF handwritting dataset to train our model. The IRONOFF dataset contains a total\textbf{ of 23000 mapped online and offline manuscript samples}.

To evaluate the quality of the synthetic signatures
\begin{itemize}
\item We use a state-of-the-art offline signature verification system;

The synthesis quality is measured by the offline verification system performance. \textbf{The questions raised are:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item is the synthetic signatures system performance similar to the offered by real offline signatures?
  \item is it feasible to increase the number of samples at the enrollment phase with the synthetic signatures generated with our proposed method?

\textbf{Each user model is trained with:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 genuine signatures

The score is measured with:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each user the remaining 12 genuine samples are used to measure the genuine score. $90 x 12 = 1080$ genuine scores
\item Random impostor scores are calculated comparing the first sample of each test subject to the enrolled model, leading to $90 x 42 = 3780$ random impostor scores.
\item The skilled impostor scores are calculated with the skilled forgeries samples of the enrolled users (12 per subject), leading to $90 x 12 = 1080$ skilled impostor scores.

We evaluate the offline signature verification system performance using only synthetic samples and using only real samples their recognition rates.

\begin{frame}{Performance Assessment}
The performance is measured as the efficiency of the signature verification system.

The system is quantitatively measured by two rates: 
\begin{itemize}
\item False Rejection Rate (FRR): genuine samples classified as forgeries;
\item False Acceptance Rate (FAR): forgeries classified as genuine.
\end{itemize}

When experimenting on signature verification systems, the trade-off between FRR and FAR must be taken into account. When the \textbf{decision threshold is set to have the FRR equal to the FAR, the Equal Error Rate (EER) }is calculated. In our experiments the EER is reported.

\note{
In the first line, we can observe the recognition rates obtained using only 4 real samples.
\vskip 0.5cm
Below it, it is reported the recognition rates using 8 real signatures, and 4 real signatures plus the synthetic signatures created with the method proposed by diaz and our proposed method.

\vskip 0.5cm
Specifically, our proposed method yields a improved recognition rate on the skilled forgery scenario
\vskip 0.5cm
In the random forgery scenario the improvement is not as good as using real signatures, but the recognition rate is better than using only four signatures.

\note{
When running the experiments thirty times, we can notice that the results have a consistent result around the mean.

It is possible for us to conclude that it is possible to user our proposed system to generate synthetic signatures to increase the enrollment dataset and improve the recognition rate of offlien signature verification systems.

\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item A Fully Convolutional Neural Network was proposed to learn an end-to-end mapping from the online to the offline domain;
\item We show that it is possible to model the "online to offline signature conversion" as a learning from data task.
\item We observe that the synthetic offline signatures generated with the proposed method offer a verification performance similar to the one offered by real signatures 
\item We show that the synthetic signatures present high discriminative power when used to increase the enrollment set under the skilled forgeries scenario.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Explore the optimization of the hyper-parameters of the FCN
(such as the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, different architectures)
\item Integrate other dynamic features in addition to the pressure on the input of the neural network, such as the velocity.
\item Design a model to synthesize offline signatures with bigger resolution.

\item Combine real online and synthetically generated offline signatures using the
proposed method, when only the online information is available, towards improved
recognition results on a dynamic signature verifier.

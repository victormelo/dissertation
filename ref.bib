abstract = {â€”The handwriting signature is one of the most po-pular behavioral biometric traits for person recognition. Such recognition systems capture the personal signing behaviour and its variability based on a limited number of enrolled signatures. In this paper a cognitive inspired model based on motor equivalence theory is developed to duplicate off-line signatures from one real on-line seed. This model achieves duplicated signatures with a natural variability. It is validated with an off-line signature verifier based on texture features and a SVM classifier. The results manifest the complementarity of the duplicated signatures and the utility of the model.},

Using 5 or 10 signatures for training is the most common case to evaluate ASV. In the scarcely addressed case of only one available signature for training, we propose to use modified duplicates. Our novel technique relies on a fully neuromuscular representation of the signatures based on the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model. This way, a real on-line signature is converted into the Sigma-Lognormal model domain. The model parameters are then varied to generate new duplicated signatures.},

@article{Ferrer2015,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a new method for generating synthetic handwritten signature images for biometric applications. The procedures we introduce imitate the mechanism of motor equivalence which divides human handwriting into two steps: the working out of an effector independent action plan and its execution via the corresponding neuromuscular path. The action plan is represented as a trajectory on a spatial grid. This contains both the signature text and its flourish, if there is one. The neuromuscular path is simulated by applying a kinematic Kaiser filter to the trajectory plan. The length of the filter depends on the pen speed which is generated using a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model. An ink deposition model, applied pixel by pixel to the pen trajectory, provides realistic static signature images. The lexical and morphological properties of the synthesized signatures as well as the range of the synthesis parameters have been estimated from real databases of real signatures such as the MCYT Off-line and the GPDS960GraySignature corpuses. The performance experiments show that by tuning only four parameters it is possible to generate synthetic identities with different stability and forgers with different skills. Therefore it is possible to create datasets of synthetic signatures with a performance similar to databases of real signatures. Moreover, we can customize the created dataset to produce skilled forgeries or simple forgeries which are easier to detect, depending on what the researcher needs. Perceptual evaluation gives an average confusion of 44.06 percent between real and synthetic signatures which shows the realism of the synthetic ones. The utility of the synthesized signatures is demonstrated by studying the influence of the pen type and number of users on an automatic signature verifier.},

The proposed algorithm follows a two steps scheme: first, the raw synthetic dynamic functions of the synthetic signature are generated; second, several ink and paper models are applied to transform the on-line data to realistic static signatures. The novel approach is validated using four different publicly available databases both real and synthetic. The experimental protocol includes the comparison of both types of signatures in terms of: i) performance evaluation of two competitive and totally different verification systems; and ii) visual appearance according to human observers. The experimental results show the high similarity existing between synthetically generated and humanly produced samples, and the potential of the proposed method for the study of the signature trait.},

abstract = {The problem of automatic signature recognition has received little attention in comparison with the problem of signature verification despite its potential applications for accessing security-sensitive facilities and for processing certain legal and historical documents. This paper presents an efficient off-line human signature recognition system based on support vector machines (SVM) and compares its performance with a traditional classification technique, multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). In both cases we propose two approaches to the problem: (1) construct each feature vector using a set of global geometric and moment-based characteristics from each signature and (2) construct the feature vector using the bitmap of the corresponding signature. We also present a mechanism to capture the intrapersonal variability of each user using just one original signature.

abstract = {On-line signature verification still remains a challenging task within biometrics. Due to their behavioural nature (opposed to anatomic biometric traits), signatures present a notable variability even between successive realizations. This leads to higher error rates than other largely used modalities such as iris or fingerprints and is one of the main reasons for the relatively slow deployment of this technology. As a step towards the improvement of signature recognition accuracy, the present paper explores and evaluates a novel approach that takes advantage of the performance boost that can be reached through the fusion of on-line and off-line signatures. In order to exploit the complementarity of the two modalities, we propose a method for the generation of enhanced synthetic static samples from on-line data. Such synthetic off-line signatures are used on a new on-line signature recognition architecture based on the combination of both types of data: real on-line samples and artificial off-line signatures synthesized from the real data. The new on-line recognition approach is evaluated on a public benchmark containing both real versions (on-line and off-line) of the exactly same signatures. Different findings and conclusions are drawn regarding the discriminative power of on-line and off-line signatures and of their potential combination both in the random and skilled impostors scenarios.},

The algorithm models a transmission channel which introduces a certain distortion into the real signature to produce the different synthetic samples. The method is used to increase the amount of data of the clients enrolling on a state-of-the-art HMM-based signature verification system. The enhanced enrollment results in performance improve up to70{\%} between the case in which only one real sample of the user was available for the training, and the case where the proposed algorithm was used to generate additional synthetic training data.},

We discuss the importance of the parameterization of the signatures in order to achieve good classification results, independently of variations in the position of the camera with respect to the writing surface. We show that affine arc-length parameterization performs better than conventional time and Euclidean arc-length ones. We find that the system verification performance is better than 4 percent error on skilled forgeries and 1 percent error on random forgeries, and that its recognition performance is better than 1 percent error rate, comparable to the best camera-based biometrics.},

To overcome this problem, techniques to generate synthetic data have been developed. This paper describes a novel technique for the automatic synthesis of human handwritten-signature images, which introduces modeled variability within the generated output based on positional variation that is naturally found within genuine source data. The synthesized data were found to generate similar verification rates to those obtained using genuine data with the use of a commercial verification engine, thereby indicating the suitability of the data synthesized by using this method for a wide range of application scenarios.},

For automatic online signature verification, rather than storing an image of the completed signature, data are represented in the form of a time series of pen position and status information allowing the extraction of temporal-based features. For visualisation purposes, signature images need to be recreated from time-series data. In this study, the authors investigate the accuracy and verification performance of a series of interpolation methods for recreating a signature image from the time-series data contained in two ISO/IEC data storage formats. The authors experiments investigate dynamic data stored at various sample rates and signature images recreated at differing resolutions. Their study indicates possible best practice in terms of image recreation method, recreated image resolution and temporal sample rate and assesses the effect on the accuracy of reconstructed signature data. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},
